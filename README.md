# Demo Root Error Next.js

This was a quick sample Next.js app that showcases the `global-error.tsx` component working (where it wasn't working in another app).

## Getting Started:

- `yarn`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn start`

Visit localhost:3000

Set a cookie to see the error, in your terminal run:

```js
cookieStore.set("__error", "1");
```

and then refresh!
